CIFAR-10 Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The CIFAR-10 dataset comprises 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

Features
----
Data Preprocessing: Normalization of image pixel values to improve model training efficiency.
Model Architecture: A CNN model composed of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers designed to classify images into one of the 10 CIFAR-10 classes.
Visualization: Code to visualize images from the dataset along with their class labels.
Training and Evaluation: Script to train the CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset and evaluate its performance on a test set.
Usage
To run this script, ensure you have TensorFlow, Keras, and Matplotlib installed in your Python environment. You can execute the script using a standard Python interpreter or within a Jupyter notebook environment.
